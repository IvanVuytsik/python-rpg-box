                                        Hi! My name is Ivan.

                   I made my CV a bit more interactive using Python.
                It provides all typical CV information in a game form.

              There is a couple of hotkeys that you might want to use:
                         key_o - on/off full screen mode
                         key_f - on/off battle map indicators

              This project uses some assets under a free use license.
                 A comprehensive list will be available on my GitHub:

                                            Enjoy your quest!
