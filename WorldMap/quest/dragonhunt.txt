   Looking you in the eye, the local
 headman begs you to help his village
 with another plague. It seems that a
  dragon has been seen in their land.
 A dragon! The local militia went out
  to scout, but no one has returned.
 You think you can't handle that, but
    your pockets are empty and this
   adventure will get its fitting finale.
