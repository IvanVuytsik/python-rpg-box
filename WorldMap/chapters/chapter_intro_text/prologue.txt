        Twelve years. That's a long time. Rowan was
        a promising soldier in his former life - a captain

       and traitors to the crown? Though it is surely a
long story full of drama, but not for my old ears. Not
  after such a long voyage to the mainland. Those island
pirates almost caught up with us. A little longer and we'd
have been feeding the sea devil or entertaining the empiri
in the arenas of Kharfageth. Well, I'm sure you can't wait
           to get off the old Edora and hit the road.
